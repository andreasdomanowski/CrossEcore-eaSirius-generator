# CrossEcore-eaSirius-generator
## About
This repository contains a build of CrossEcore's [crossecore-generator](https://github.com/andreasdomanowski/eaSirius/tree/crossecore-build-integration) (forked and adapted to work with  [eaSirius](https://github.com/andreasdomanowski/eaSirius/)) that is packaged as an Eclipse plugin.
To avoid the hassle of configuring a p2 repository, the build is distributed via this git repo.
